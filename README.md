## Introduction
A ring buffer is a fixed-size buffer that works as if the memory is contiguous and circular in nature. This data structure is useful for buffering data streams.

## Features
- Fixed-size buffer
- Efficient memory usage
- FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ringbuf.git
```
